        While walking across an open, grassy field, I became excited as my hand
        swooped toward the ground like an eagle attacking its prey. I picked up
        half of a $5 bill. I continued to walk around looking for the other half
        but thought to myself it would be impossible to find it on such a windy
        day. As I lifted my head, I spotted the other half of the bill tangled
        in crabgrass. Somehow, finding two halves of a ripped $5 bill felt
        better than working for a twenty. â€”Submitted by Ron Fleming, Fort Drum,
